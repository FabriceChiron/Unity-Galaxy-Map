  Name: Uranus
  Details: Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary
    radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar
    in composition to Neptune, and both have different bulk chemical composition
    from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists
    often classify Uranus and Neptune as \"ice giants\" to distinguish them from
    the gas giants.
