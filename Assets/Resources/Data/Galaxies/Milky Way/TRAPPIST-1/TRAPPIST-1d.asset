  Name: TRAPPIST-1d
  Details: "<b>TRAPPIST-1d</b>, also designated as <b>2MASS J23062928-0502285 d</b>,
    is a small exoplanet (about 30% the mass of the earth), which orbits on the inner
    edge of the habitable zone of the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1 approximately
    40 light-years (12.1 parsecs, or nearly 3.7336\xD71014 km) away from Earth in
    the constellation of Aquarius. The exoplanet was found by using the transit method,
    in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its
    star is measured. The first signs of the planet were announced in 2016, but it
    wasn't until the following years that more information concerning the probable
    nature of the planet was obtained. TRAPPIST-1d is the least massive planet of
    the system and is likely to have a compact hydrogen-poor atmosphere similar to
    Venus, Earth, or Mars. It receives just 4.3% more sunlight than Earth, placing
    it on the inner edge of the habitable zone. It has about <5% of its mass as a
    volatile layer, which could consist of atmosphere, oceans, and/or ice layers.
    Recent studies by the University of Washington have concluded that TRAPPIST-1d
    might be a Venus-like exoplanet with an uninhabitable atmosphere. The planet
    is an eyeball planet candidate."
