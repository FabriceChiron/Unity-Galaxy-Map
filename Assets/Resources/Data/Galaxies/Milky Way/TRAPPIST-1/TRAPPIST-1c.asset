  Name: TRAPPIST-1c
  Details: <b>TRAPPIST-1c</b>, also designated as <b>2MASS J23062928-0502285 c</b>,
    is a mainly rocky, Venus-like exoplanet orbiting around the ultracool dwarf star
    TRAPPIST-1 approximately 40 light-years away from Earth in the constellation
    Aquarius. It is the most massive and third largest planet of the system, with
    about 116% the mass and 110% the radius of Earth. Its density indicates a primarily
    rocky composition with a very thick Venus-like atmosphere, although it is expected
    to be thinner than that of TRAPPIST-1b.
