  StarDescription: "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is
    a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion
    reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet
    light, and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy
    for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles),
    or 109 times that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, and
    it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three
    quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium
    (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon,
    neon and iron.  According to its spectral class, the Sun is a G-type main-sequence
    star (G2V). As such, it is informally, and not completely accurately, referred
    to as a yellow dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It formed approximately
    4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a region
    of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas
    the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central
    mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its
    core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.  The Sun's core
    fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting
    4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which
    can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape the core, is the source of
    the Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to
    the point at which the Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core
    will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers
    expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is calculated that
    the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury
    and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable \u2013 but not for about five billion
    years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling
    star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion, but still
    glow and give off heat from its previous fusion."
