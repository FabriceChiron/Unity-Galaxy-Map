  Name: Jupiter
  Details: Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar
    System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but
    two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.
    Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune
    are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans
    named it after their god Jupiter.
